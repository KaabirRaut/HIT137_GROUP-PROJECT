This GitHub repository includes all the files created for our HIT137 group assignment. It has Python programs for tasks like encrypting and decrypting text, working with weather data, and drawing using turtle graphics. We also included input and output text files. The goal of this project is to apply what we learned in class using real code. Everyone in the team contributed equally  with writing code, testing, and preparing documents. To run the program you can just open the Python files in VS code
